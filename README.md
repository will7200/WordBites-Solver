## Word Bites Solver
I have been enjoying the new game word-bites on game pigeon. 
They implemented a new feature that gives all the wordsWorker possible on the game that is really cool.
The only downside is that is quite expensive to utilize.

So this is my go at implementing the solver from scratch. I will document all my findings
over at RESEARCH.md.

## TODO
1. UI  
- [X] Tile Grid
- [X] Character(s) Block creator

2. Web Worker in Rust 
- [X] Algorithm to Solve all possible wordsWorker
